the tower commission report which says president reagan was ignorant about much of the iran arms deal just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in washington political analysts said     "this is certification of incompetence" private political analyst stephen hess told reuters in commenting on the tower report made public today     "its as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials"     in one of the most direct criticisms board chairman john tower a longtime reagan supporter and former republican senator from texas told a press conference "the president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation"     the report which lent credence to widespread opinion in washington that reagan is not in full command of the government was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the republican presidents own choosing     the threemember panel made up of tower former national security adviser brent scowcroft and former secretary of state edmund muskie does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a congress controlled by the democratic party     "were falling by our own hand" said one republican political strategist "what can we say except were sorry we wont do it again"     the strategist who works for one of his partys top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified said the report was like "an anvil falling on us"     hess with the brookings institution public policy study group said the report is the final blow to reagans hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with congress the press and the washington bureaucracy     the report may also undermine the standing of defense secretary caspar weinberger and secretary of state george shultz who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president     "they protected the record as to their own positions on this issue they were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences" it said     white house chief of staff donald regan and former central intelligence agency director william casey also received strong criticism but the blows were expected in their cases     regan expected to resign or be fired shortly was savaged for allegedly failing both to help reagan conduct the iran initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process     casey who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in december had already resigned for health reasons last month     "this is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes" tower told reporters     while reagan retains considerable constitutional powers including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the countrys policy agenda  particularly with congress controlled by the democrats     the crucial remaining question they said is whether the man in the street will forsake reagan over the affair     although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with iran became public last november his personal popularity is still relatively high     a los angeles times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought reagan was in control of the government but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president     american enterprise institute analyst william schneider a democrat says reagans loss of support among washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public     "in the past he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public" schneider said     reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week     but one top republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround     "the white house has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met" said the strategist who requested anonymity "they have to recognize there is no quick fix"     analysts also point out that reagans personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies     they note he was dramatically rebuffed in last novembers elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the senate to the democrats  reuter

a study on grain certificates due out shortly from the government accounting office gao could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays administration and industry sources said     analysis that the gao has obtained from the agriculture department and the office of management and budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments a gao official told reuters     gao is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of sen jesse helms rnc former chairman of the senate agriculture committee     the report which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash is scheduled to be released in mid march     the cost of certificates said the gao source depends on the programs impact on the usda loan program     if gao determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures then the net cost of the program would go up however if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease the cost effect of certificates would be less     gao will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded the gao official said     but a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program" an agricultural consultant said     the omb is said to be against any expansion of the program while usda remains firmly committed to it  reuter

opec may be forced to meet before a scheduled june session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices oil industry analysts said     "the movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as opec thought they may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems" said daniel yergin director of cambridge energy research associates cera     analysts and oil industry sources said the problem opec faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets     "opecs problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way" said paul mlotok oil analyst with salomon brothers inc     he said the markets earlier optimism about opec and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices     but some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of opec production above the 158 mln bpd quota set last december     "opec has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas fixed prices and set differentials" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named "the market is now trying to teach them that lesson again" he added     david t mizrahi editor of mideast reports expects opec to meet before june although not immediately however he is not optimistic that opec can address its principal problems     "they will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil but in late march and april when demand slackens" mizrahi said     but mizrahi said that opec is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 158 mln bpd"     analysts said that the next two months will be critical for opecs ability to hold together prices and output     "opec must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then" said dillard spriggs of petroleum analysis ltd in new york     but bijan moussavarrahmani of harvard universitys energy and environment policy center said that the demand for opec oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production     "demand for their opec oil is clearly above 158 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is opec meeting this demand through current production" he told reuters in a telephone interview  reuter

switzerlands economy combining low unemployment financial stability and a large external payments surplus is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd said     this reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government it said     the oecd in its annual report on switzerland picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pickup in inflation this year but said these gave no cause for concern     the study forecast a decline in gross domestic product growth to 175 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 125 pct after last years sharp fall to 075 pct from 36 pct in 1985     but it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct the lowest in the 24industrial nation oecd area     assuming an average exchange rate of 171 swiss francs to the dollar this year against 169 in the second half of 1986 the report forecast a 275 pct rise in exports and a 35 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 325 pct and 65 pct respectively in 1986     the faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last reflecting buoyant private consumption meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to gdp would shrink in both years     but "given switzerlands large external surplus there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than gdpwhich if only in a small way would contribute to improving international balances" the oecd said     real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year with a 325 pct growth rate after several years of relative weakness it noted     in 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 225 pct growth rate but should still outstrip overall gdp it added     the outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987 and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors it said     as a consequence growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986     but the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry two major service sector earners of foreign exchange     the longterm appreciation of the swiss franc and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets could lead to a loss of international market share for both it said     particularly for the banks "recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the swiss financial system which has shown substantial flexibility in the past is adapting itself at the speed required  to preserve its competitive position" it said  reuter

frances right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year     moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 25 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 28 per cent from a 28 per cent target written into the annual budget last september     finance minister edouard balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation budgetcutting rigour and pay restraint     but trade union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises     and bank economists contacted by reuters said they believed prime minister jacques chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year perhaps in the autumn to boost his prospects in presidential elections due by april 1988     "the outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago" said societe generale economist alain marais "we have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year"     "the big question is whether the governments policy of wage moderation will be maintained" he added     the government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 17 per cent this year with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity     but the head of the socialist cfdt union federation edmond maire meeting with chirac today renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices     calling the governments policies "unbalanced and unjust" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment he announced after his meeting that chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training     andre bergeron a widely respected leader of the moderate force ouvriere labour group put similar demands to chirac earlier in the week while the communistled cgt the largest of frances unions declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority     but with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month and still rising government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident chirac could resist union pay demands     "salary indexation was ended by the previous socialist government and i dont think this administration is going to reverse that" commented michel develle economist at recentlyprivatised banque paribas     damaging transport and electricity strikes over christmas and the new year partly blamed by the government for higher inflation had undermined the unions power and popularity he said     develle said paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast perhaps to 26 or 27 per cent this year against last years 21 per cent     "but that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the second world war all french prices have been freed" he commented     finance ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 09 per cent surge in january living costs     but they claimed it was a onceoff phenomenon that should have no knockon impact on the rest of the year     both marais and develle said they agreed with that so long as the government kept wages under control     prices could rise 15 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year fractionally more than forecast this week by the national statistics institute insee  marais said but the second half year should be better he added     ironically one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit several analysts said     so long as public sector wages are held down higher value added tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth they said      reuter

italys strong economic revival has led some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects but many italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive     "i think all this foreign interest in the socalled italian miracle is really exaggeratedforeign observers always oscillate in the case of italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism" says luigi spaventa one of italys leading economists and a professor at rome university     according to spaventa these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years with italy one minute seen as the "bad boy of europe" and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration     "i think theres a lot of exaggerationonce it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to italy to study this that was another story about nothing  like writing about a black cat in a dark room"     spaventa in tune with other economists and industrialists here stress italys recent achievements particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises but warns that the economy is still vulnerable      profits of private sector firms such as fiat spa  and  are booming the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed expectations by some experts that italy is poised to replace britain as the worlds fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism     italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its secondrate status among the major industrialised countries     only this week it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the group of five g5  comprising the united states japan west germany france and britain     italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in tokyo last year to let italy and canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system     but italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy economists and industrialists say     "we must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy" warns fiat managing director cesare romiti     he says that while italys recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved     the countrys huge state sector deficit high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems experts say     the size of the state spending deficit  estimated at 109561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100000 billion lire this year  means there is a risk inflation could spiral again says carlo scognamiglio head of the private luiss university in rome     inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in september 1984 and by january this year was running at 45 pct but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness economists and industrialists say     and unemployment was running at 116 pct nationally last october according to the latest official data     recent official data showed that of a total 277 million people seeking work in october 1986 almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29 unemployment in the south was running at 177 pct more than double that in the industrial north     the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd recently forecast that italian gross domestic product gdp would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 25 pct in 1986 but it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment     another problem is italys reliance on imported raw materials the country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs     this factor actually worked sharply in italys favour last year when lower energy costs helped slash the countrys trade deficit to 3717 billion lire  by year end from 23085 billion lire in 1985     but economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences     if italy truly wants to be counted among the worlds top industrialised nations it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities economists say     italy has no controls on insider trading     the country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls  a european community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992  but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures economists say     "even today if i wanted to invest in the tokyo bourse i doubt id find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that" says spaventa  reuter

directors of the chicago mercantile exchange will meet wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widelypopular standard and poors 500 stock index futures pit an exchange executive said     the petition calls for elimination of dual trading a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account     but exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called "frontrunning" where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers     leo melamed cme special counsel said directors will rule on the petition on wednesday but added that a special s and p advisory committee has been studying s and p 500 futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days     in addition to a recommendation on dual trading melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for s and p 500 futures and futuresoptions and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit     melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because "most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations"     cme senior vice president gerald beyer said if the board accepts the members petition this week a rule change will be submitted to the commodity futures trading commission for approval     if the board does nothing or rejects the petition request a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within 15 days beyer said     melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made "it will confuse the issue"     not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading     although jonathan wolff senior vice president at donaldson lufkin and jenrette noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges     "its a question of the integrity of the person you do business with" wolff said     futures traders who act as brokers however maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits     "to have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors" said john michael vice president at first options of chicago     "what it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved" he said     furthermore the competitive nature of futures brokerage makes frontrunning risky to a brokers livelihood he said     "if i ever discovered a broker doing it frontrunning or even suspected him of doing it i would cut him off" michael said     an average broker in the treasury bond futures pit for instance will fill orders for 5000 to 10000 contracts a day at 125 dlrs per contract floor sources said  even figuring what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative     frontrunning by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move but also the risk of losing the brokerage business michael said  reuter
